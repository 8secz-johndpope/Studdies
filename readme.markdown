# Studdies
by Arielle and Jayme</br></br>

## Premise
Studdies is a productivity app that uses certain interactive elements to keep users focused and determined to complete tasks. </br></br>
Users can keep track of their progress and feel rewarded when completing tasks.</br></br>

## Inspiration

</br></br>
## Mechanics
**“Health” system** - failing to complete tasks will result in a decrease in health (shown on the EXP screen), which when depleted, docks experience points</br></br>
**Procrastination prevention** - completing tasks prior to the deadline will earn you bonus experience</br></br>
**Streaks** - finish tasks on time for 3 days in a row to gain a “streak”, which adds a 2x multiplier to your experience gain</br></br>

## Users
Upon downloading the app, the user will be prompted to create a profile which will track progress and store EXP earned by completing tasks.
</br></br>
## Main Task Screen
The main task screen offers the user a view of their tasks in list format.</br></br>

The information on screen includes: task name, task due date, expected time needed.
User may toggle the view button to switch to calendar format.

## Weekly Timeline
This is a subscreen from the main task view that appears when the task view button is toggled from list format to calendar format. </br></br>
It is a view of the current week’s tasks, in the form of a calendar.

</br></br>
## Create a Task

Creating a task is simple. The user simply clicks the plus button on the main screen, then fills out the information and criteria of the task.</br></br>

Once the user is finished, they may hit the submit button, and the task will be added to the plan.

</br></br>
## Work Mode
During work mode the user may keep track of their objective on screen.</br></br>
Sub objectives can be created to enrich the task.

</br></br>
## Health and Experience screen
Health is represented by a small plant. It is a visual representation of success.</br></br>
Everytime the user loses health, the plant decays. </br></br>
It “dies” after 5 losses.

## Areas of Interest
**Push Notification Reminders** </br>
The user may set a specific time of the day at which the app will notify the user of their task(s).</br>
If an uncompleted task is past the deadline, a notification will remind the user of their outstanding task(s), and prompt to reschedule.
</br></br>
**Advertisements** </br>
The standard version of the Studdies app will use apple ads service to display advertisement.</br>
In the future, a stretch goal will have an option for users go through in app purchases to remove ads.
</br></br>
**Achievements and Leaderboard** </br>
Like an actual RPG game, our app, depending on user’s action will grant them different achievements to which they can show off.</br>
In addition, the user will also have access to a leaderboard that shows their ranking.
